In this double challenge, I demonstrate the power of lists in Python to take in data from a csv file containing data.

In the **PyBank** challenge, I take data from a csv file containing profit losses over a period of time.  Moving the data into lists, I am able to process the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

I print the above results to the terminal and also write to a text file.


In the **PyPoll** challenge, I take data from a csv file containing votes and am tasked to find the following: 

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Similar to the PyBank, I print the results to the terminal and also export the results to a text file.

In both challenges, the use of for loops where helpful in not only moving the data from csv files into lists, but also in processing calculations such as the total and average as demonstrated in the **PyBank** challenge, as well as in searching for particular data such as the winner of the election as seen in the **PyPoll** challenge.
